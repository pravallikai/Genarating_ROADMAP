TO RESTART AND RUN YOUR PROJECT FROM SCRATCH:

STEP 1: START THE BACKEND SERVER
In Terminal 1 (Command Prompt):

bash
# 1. Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\pvemu\Documents\ai_learning_path_generator

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# 3. Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
Keep Terminal 1 running - this is your server.

STEP 2: OPEN THE FRONTEND
In Terminal 2 (New Command Prompt):

bash
# 1. Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\pvemu\Documents\ai_learning_path_generator

# 2. Open the HTML file in browser
start index.html
Or manually open in browser: file:///C:/Users/pvemu/Documents/ai_learning_path_generator/index.html

STEP 3: TEST THE APPLICATION
Backend should show in Terminal 1:

text
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Frontend should open in browser

Test with:

Goal: "Learn Python"

Level: "Beginner"

Time: "10 hours per week"

Click "Generate My Project-Based Roadmap"

IF YOU NEED TO START COMPLETELY FRESH:
bash
# Delete everything and restart
cd C:\Users\pvemu\Documents
rmdir /s /q ai_learning_path_generator
mkdir ai_learning_path_generator
cd ai_learning_path_generator

# Then copy the new main.py and index.html files I provided
# Then follow steps 1-3 above
