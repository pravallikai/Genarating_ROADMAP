What I Built: The Intelligent Learning Roadmap Generator
I built an AI-powered web application that helps people learn new skills by creating personalized, step-by-step study plans. If someone wants to learn something like Python programming or web development but feels overwhelmed by where to start, my app solves that. It asks the user a few simple questions—like their goal, current skill level, and available time—and then uses artificial intelligence to generate a custom learning roadmap. This roadmap includes free video tutorials, hands-on projects, articles, and community support recommendations, all structured into a clear weekly schedule.

How It Works: The Technology I Used
I built this project using a combination of modern and reliable technologies:

Backend (The Brain): I used Python with the FastAPI framework to create the server that handles all the logic. This backend validates user input, communicates with the AI service, and structures the response. I used Uvicorn as the server and Pydantic to ensure all data was correctly formatted and secure.

Frontend (The Interface): I built the website interface with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep it fast and simple. The design is clean, responsive, and works on all devices. I integrated Chart.js for progress visualizations, Font Awesome for icons, and Google Fonts for a better reading experience.

Artificial Intelligence (The Advisor): The "intelligent" part is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. I accessed it through the OpenRouter API, which acts as a gateway. This AI analyzes the user's input and generates a coherent, educational plan with weekly themes, objectives, and resource suggestions.

Real Resources (The Content): I connected the system to real, free educational content from platforms like YouTube (for tutorial videos) and GitHub (for practice projects). I also curated a database of free courses from sites like Coursera and edX, ensuring every recommended link is valid and helpful.

Key Features of My Application
Personalized Learning Paths: Every roadmap is uniquely tailored to the individual's goals and constraints.

Visual Progress Tracking: Users can check off completed weeks and see their progress update on a timeline and progress bar.

100% Free Resources: The system exclusively recommends openly available learning materials, with no paid content or subscriptions.

Project-Based Approach: Each weekly module includes a practical project to apply the newly learned concepts.

Built-in Community Guidance: The roadmap suggests relevant online communities (like Discord servers or subreddits) where learners can get help.

Why I Built This Project
I created this tool based on the belief that high-quality education should be free and accessible to everyone. In an online learning landscape often filled with paid courses and fragmented tutorials, my app provides clear, structured, and empathetic guidance—without any cost to the user. It demonstrates how AI can be used as a tool for empowerment, organizing the vast amount of free educational content on the internet into a coherent, personal learning journey.

What Makes My Project Unique
My system stands out because it:

Does not require any login or payment, respecting user privacy and accessibility.

Uses a modern AI model to understand context and create pedagogically sound plans.

Relies on a curated database of verified, free resources.

Emphasizes learning by doing through integrated projects.

Was built with accessibility in mind, following best practices so it can be used by as many people as possible.

In Summary
I created a smart, accessible, and completely free learning assistant. It acts like a digital mentor that can instantly create a structured study plan from the best free resources available online, making self-directed learning efficient, organized, and achievable for anyone.
